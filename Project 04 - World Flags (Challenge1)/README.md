# World Flags

#### World Flags is a challenge project that uses most of the features that I learned from the three first projects. It contains a UITableViewController that displays the name and an small image of each country flag and when the user taps on a specific country it will send us to a UIViewController that displays a bigger flag for that country and it has a UIBarButtonItem to share a flag image or save it on the Photo Library.

## Main Points:

* UIActivityViewController
