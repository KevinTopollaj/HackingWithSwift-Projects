# Word Scramble

#### Word Scramble is a game project that deals with anagrams where a long word is displayed in the title of the app and users have to create smaller words from it and submit them in the UITextField that is inside the Alert where each word will be checked if it is a possible word using UITextChecker, a word that has not been used before and the word is different from the title word.

## Main Points:

* UITableViewController (  reloadData( ), insertRows(at: , with: )  )
* Using Closures and breaking Strong-Reference-Cycles using 'weak'
* Actions using @objc to expose a method to Objective-C
* Alerts ( UIAlertController, UIAlertAction )
* UINavigationController
* UIBarButtonItem
* UITextChecker
* App Bundle
* UITextField
* Storyboard
* Guard
