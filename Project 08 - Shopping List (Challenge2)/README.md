# Shopping List

#### Shopping List is a challenge project where users can add their shopping items in a UITableViewController using a UIAlertController with a text field to let them enter their items in the table view as long as the text field is not empty. Users also can share or copy their list using UIActivityViewController, they can delete a specific item in the list or they can delete all items using a UIBarButtonItem to empty the list and add new items into the list.

## Main Points:

* UITableViewController (  reloadData( ), insertRows(at: , with: ), deleteRows(at: , with: )  )
* UIActivityViewController
* Using Closures and breaking Strong-Reference-Cycles using 'weak'
* Actions using @objc to expose a method to Objective-C
* Alerts ( UIAlertController, UIAlertAction )
* UINavigationController
* UIBarButtonItem
* UITextField
* Storyboard
* Guard
