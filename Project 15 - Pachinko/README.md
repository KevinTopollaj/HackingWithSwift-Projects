# Pachinko

#### Pachinko is a game project where I learned about the SpriteKit framework to build a 2D game. The game consists on four slots, 2 green (good) and 2 red (bad) four bouncers some boxes that the user can create on Edit mode and 10 balls where the user has to put the balls on the green slots to win 1point and avoid the red slots where he loses 1point, also the player can increase the dificulty of the game by putting different obsacles on the screen when they are on Edit mode.

## Main Points:

* SpriteKit
