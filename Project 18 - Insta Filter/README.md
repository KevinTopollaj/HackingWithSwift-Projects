# Insta Filter

#### Insta Filter is a project where I learned about the CoreImage framework that is used for high performance image manipulation. In this app user can select a photo using the add UIBarButtonItem that will open the photo library using the UIImagePickerController, after that the selected image will be displayed in the app and the user can use the ChangeFilter UIButton to change the filter and than the UISlider to apply the right amount of filter that they want on the image and when they are satisfied with the image they can tap on the Save button to save the image to the iOS photo album.

## Main Points:

* CoreImage ( CIContext, CIFilter, CIImage, CIVector )
* Writing images to the iOS photo album
* UIView
* UINavigationController
* UIBarButtonItem
* UIImagePickerController ( isSourceTypeAvailable( ), sourceType )
* UIImagePickerControllerDelegate
* UINavigationControllerDelegate
* UIImageView
* UIImage
* UILabel
* UIButton
* UISlider
* Using Closures and breaking Strong-Reference-Cycles using 'weak'
* Alerts ( UIAlertController, UIAlertAction )
* Actions using @objc to expose a method to Objective-C
