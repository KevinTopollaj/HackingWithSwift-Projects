# Whack a Penguin

#### Whack a Penguin is a game project where I learned more about the SpriteKit framework that is used for 2D games. This app consists on a game where 18-slots are placed in the scene and penguins are shown from each slot in different times, the user has to hit the Red Penguins to win one point and avoid hiting the Blue Penguins where they will lose five points and after some rounds the game will end.
