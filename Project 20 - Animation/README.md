#### Animation is a technique project where I learned about animations. The main purpouse of animations is to give users a sense of a state change in the app and to make that transition attractive for the user.

## Main Points:

* UIView
* Animation ( .animate(withDuration: , animations: ) )
* UIImageView
* UIImage
* UIButton
* Closures
* CGAffineTransform
* Spring Animations
* Alpha Values
