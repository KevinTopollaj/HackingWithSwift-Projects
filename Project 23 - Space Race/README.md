# Space Race

#### Space Race is a game project where I learned more about the SpriteKit framework. In this project I created a game where the user has a space ship and by tapping on it and dragging it on the screen he has to avoid colliding with other object that are in the space like basket balls, hammers and tv's. By doing so he will gain points and when he collides with another object the space ship will explode and the game will be over.
