# Debugging

#### Debugging is a technique project where I learned the most used debugging methods to use in applications. Starting from the print() method to print the result of a variable or function, than ussing assertions that are debug-only checks that will force your app to crash if a specific condition isn't true, assertion check code is never executed in a live app, so your users are never aware of their presence. Another way to debugg is using breakpoints which will stop our app when we run and will give us the program state at the places we have placed a breakpoint. We can add conditions to breakpoints that will trigger them when that condition is meet, or we can make tham to be automatically triggered when an exception is thrown. The last debugging technique is View Debugging which is used to debugg the application view hierarchy.
