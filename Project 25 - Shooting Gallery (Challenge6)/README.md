# Shooting Gallery

#### Shooting Gallery is a challenge project where I learned more about SpriteKit and created a game form scratch. The game is called shooting gallery where the user has a scene and in the scene will slide duck images that the user has to shoot to win points and a target table that the user has to avoid but the user has to reload after 3-shoots so he can continue to shoot more ducks. The game will last 120-seconds and the goal for the user is to win as much points as possible.
