# JavaScript Injection

#### JavaScript Injection is a project where I learned how to create safari extensions wich allows us to embed a version of our app inside safari action button to manipulate data in safari by reading the url and page title that the user was visiting and than show a text area where they can type javascript and execute that javascript code in safari.
