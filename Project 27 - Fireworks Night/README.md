# Fireworks Night

#### Fireworks Night is a game project where I learned more about SpriteKit framework. This game consists on fireworks being displayed on the screen five at a time in different positions and moving through the screen. Fireworks will contain three different colors: cyan, red, green. The user must select the same color fireworks and than shake the iPad to make them explode to win points. After five rounds the game will be over and the user has the option to start a new game to play again and win more points.
