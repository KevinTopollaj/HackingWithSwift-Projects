# Detect a Beacon

#### Detect a Beacon is a project where I learned about CoreLocation framework. This project is created to detect iBeacons and their range in the real world, so I learned how to ask the user for their location. The application will detect an iBeacon and based on the range it will change the background color and the tex displayed on the screen.

* CoreLocation Framework
