# Swifty Ninja

#### Swifty Ninja is a game project where I learned more about SpriteKit framework and the AVFoundation framework for playing audio. This game consists on penguins and bombs being thrown in the screen and the user has to slice only the penguins if he slices a bomb the game is over and if he misses a penguin he will lose one life, if the user loses all the lifes than the game will be over.
