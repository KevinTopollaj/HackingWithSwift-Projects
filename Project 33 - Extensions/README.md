# Extensions

#### Extensions is a challenge project where I completed three challenges using the extension keyword in Swift to extend the functionality of UIView, Int and Array. 

## Main Points:


* UIView
* TimeInterval
* Animation
* CGAffineTransform
* Int
* guard
* Closures
* Array
* mutating
* Comparable protocol
