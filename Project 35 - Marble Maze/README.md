# Marble Maze

#### Marble Maze is a game project where I learned about the CoreMotion framework and also reviewed the SpriteKit framework. The main purpose of the game is that the user catches all the stars using the marble and avoid all vortexes that will make him start from the beginning. All of this will be done using the Accelerometer in real devices so the user can move the iPad to controle the marble.
