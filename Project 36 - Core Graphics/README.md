# Core Graphics

#### Core Graphics is a technique project where I learned about the CoreGraphics framework. The main purpose of this project is to look at the  CoreGraphics framework which is resposible for 2D drawing starting from shapes, paths, shadows, colors, images and so on. CoreGraphics is also a device independent framework which means you can draw things on the screen or draw them on a pdf without having to change anything in the code.
