# Exploding Monkeys

#### Exploding Monkeys is a game project where I learned more about the SpriteKit and CoreGraphics frameworks. The game consists in two players where each one can throw a banana to the other at a specific angle and speed. If the banana hits a building it will destroy a part of it and if it hits a player the game will be over and a new game will start where the player that lost the game will start to throw first.
