# Four in a Row

#### Four in a Row is a game project where I learned about GameplayKit which is a library designed to handle non-drawing game functionality such as artificial intelligence, path finding and randomness. In this project, we're going to create a Four-in-a-Row (4IR) game, where the user will play against an AI opponent and try to get four chips of the red color in a row in every direction.
