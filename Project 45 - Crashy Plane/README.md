# Crashy Plane

#### Crashy Plane is a game project where I learned more about SpriteKit and created a clone of the famous Flappy Bird game. Crashy Plane might seem like a remarkably simple game when you’re playing it, but has a lot going on behind the scenes: there’s physics, animation, infinite scrolling, and more.
