# Psychic Tester

#### Psychic Tester is a game project where I learned to create an app that will show the user eight cards face down, and users need to tap the card that has a star on its flip side. All this using animations, @IBDesignable, @IBInspectable and a 3D flip for the cards.

## Main Points:

* @IBDesignable
* @IBInspectable
* CAGradientLayer
* UIViewController
* UIView
* Animation
* UIAlertController
* UIAlertAction
* UIImageView
* UIImage
* CAEmitterLayer
* CAEmitterCell
* Bundle
* Actions using @objc to expose a method to Objective-C
